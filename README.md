# Escape-Room 🔑
Welcome to the **Escape Room* project, an interactive and immersive experience built using Arduino Uno board. **The goal:** To challenge players with a sequence of tasks that reveal a 4-digit code required to complete the Escape Room. We encourage players to test their logic, speed and observation skills interacting with various sensor to unlock the code.
# Description 📖
Upon starting the game, players are greeted by an LCD screen displaying a "press button" message. To progress, users must successufully complete four unique steps, such as light detection to ultrasonic distance measurement to unlock each digit for the 4-digit final code on the keypad.
# Features 🌟
* **Button press task:** By pressing a specific button for a number of times, the first digit will be generated.'
* **Blinking LED task:** By pressing a specific button, an LED will blink for a random number of times, representing the second digit.
* **Ultrasonic Sensor task:** When an object is detected within 3 cm of the sensor, another digit will be displayed on the LCD.
* **Light Sensor task:** A 4x4 keypad allows players to enter their discovered code to verify if they have escaped the challenge.
* **Real-time Feedback:** After entering the code, the LCD provides immediate "You escaped!" or "Try again!" messages.
